	Notify user of application termination on license nonacceptance
.05
    FreeCad.pas & scrMain.pas 
	Add code for Linux version to find window names, mods to python module we create, see below:
	There is something stange with referenceing objects on FreeCad dialog in the functions that will
	be called via python.  Using the local namespace ie FreeCadFrm.lblEdgeCnt.Caption or  FreeCADFrm.PyOutMemo.Lines.Add('xyz')
	results in an access viloation.  I suspect this is because  FreeCADFrm is dynamically created in srcMain.
	However, if we reference it from the creator (scrMain  ie srcMain.MyFreeCADFrm.lblEdgeCnt.Caption ) we can get this to work
